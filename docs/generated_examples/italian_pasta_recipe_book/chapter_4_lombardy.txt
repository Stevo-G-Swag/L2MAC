Chapter 4: Northern Delights - Lombardy

Introduction to Lombardy
Lombardy, located in the northern part of Italy, is known for its rich dairy production, which plays a significant role in its culinary traditions, especially pasta dishes. The region is famous for its creamy and comforting dishes, such as Risotto alla Milanese and Pizzoccheri, which reflect the northern Italian preference for butter, cheese, and other dairy products over the olive oil and tomatoes more commonly used in the south.

The history of pasta in Lombardy is less about pasta itself and more about rice and other grains, given the region's climate and agricultural output. However, pasta dishes like Pizzoccheri have become staples of Lombard cuisine, showcasing the region's ability to blend its dairy riches with the simplicity of pasta to create hearty, comforting meals.
