# Gallery of Examples

We include a gallery of example applications entirely produced by the LLM Automatic Computer (L2MAC) from a single input prompt. L2MAC excels at solving large complex tasks, such as being state-of-the-art for generating large codebases, or it can even write entire books, all of which bypass the traditional constraints of the LLMs fixed context window constraint.
